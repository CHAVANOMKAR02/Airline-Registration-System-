# Airline Registration System

This project is an airline registration system implemented in C++. The system allows users to register as passengers, book flights, and manage their reservations. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the airline's services.

## Features

1. User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their personal information, such as name, age, address, and gender.

2. Flight Booking: Registered users can search for available flights based on their preferred destination. The system provides a list of flights for different countries, including Dubai, Canada, UK, USA, Australia, and Europe. Users can select their desired flight and book it.

3. Ticket Generation: After booking a flight, the system generates a ticket for the user. The ticket includes the customer ID, name, gender, destination, flight details, and charges.

4. Ticket Display: Users can view their generated ticket, which displays the information about their flight and the charges.

## How to Use

1. Run the program: Compile and run the C++ code.

2. Main Menu: The program displays a main menu with several options:

   - Option 1: Add Customer Details - Allows users to enter their personal information to register as a passenger.
   - Option 2: Flight Registration - Users can choose their desired flight and book it.
   - Option 3: Get Ticket and Charges - Generates a ticket for the user and displays the charges.
   - Option 4: Exit - Terminates the program.

3. Select an Option: Choose the desired option by entering the corresponding number.

4. Follow the Prompts: The program will provide prompts for each option, such as entering customer details, selecting a flight, or displaying a ticket.

5. Continue or Exit: After completing an operation, the program will give an option to go back to the main menu or exit.

6. Repeat or Terminate: Users can perform multiple operations in succession or choose to exit the program.

## Dependencies

This program requires a C++ compiler to compile and run the code. Make sure you have a compatible compiler installed on your system.

## Note

Please note that this README file assumes that you have a basic understanding of C++ programming and how to compile and run C++ code on your system. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check your C++ compiler and environment setup.
